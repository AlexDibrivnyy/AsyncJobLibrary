AsyncJobLibrary
===============

Android library to easily queue background and UI tasks

##Why AsyncJob?

In my lasts projects I started using [Android Annotations](http://androidannotations.org/), which has an amazing set of tools to make creating Android applications a lot easier.

However, for some stuff I wanted to make having to inherit from auto-built classes was an impossible thing to do and I ended up having half of my project using *AndroidAnnotations* and the other half doing stuff manually.

So I thought: maybe I should try [ButterKnife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) instead. That worked better, I could inject views whenever I wanted and I still had some of the "@Click" stuff I liked.

But not everything was good. *AndroidAnnotations* had a pair of annotations called **@Background** and **@UIThread** which magically -well, not so magically- allowed your code to be executed on the UI Thread or on a Background one with no effort. I *REALLY* missed those annotations as they allowed me to have a way cleaner code, so I started thinking how could I replace them.

**AsyncJob** was the closest I got to that.

##So what does it exactly do?

If you are working on Android you probably have ended up using AsyncTasks to do background tasks and then have a response on the UI Thread. Well, I'll confess: **I HATE ASYNCTASKS**.

I don't see why I would need to extend a class *EVERY FUCKING TIME* I want to do some work on background. Also, having to create a Thread and a Handler *EVERY FUCKING TIME* I wanted to do some background work and have a response wasn't a good option.

So what I did is creating a library which does that for you.

##How does it work?

It's really easy. If you want the library to work in a similar way to *AsyncTask*, you can create an ``AsyncJob<JobResult>`` where **JobResult** is the type or class of the item it will return.

But creating an **AsyncJob** was also a boring thing to do so I created an ``AsyncJobBuilder<T>`` which allows you to create **AsyncJobs** in a fast and clean way.

**AsyncJobs** have two interfaces which will be used to store your code and execute it on backgrund or on the main thread. These are
``AsyncAction<ActionResult>`` and ``
AsyncResultAction<ActionResult>``. They can be set by:

``java
asyncJob.setActionInBackground(actionInBackground);
asyncJob.setActionOnResult(actionOnMainThread);
``

And when you use ``asyncJob.start()`` it will call those interfaces and execute your code.

Here you have an example of an **AsyncJob** created by an **AsyncJobBuilder**:

```java
new AsyncJob.AsyncJobBuilder<Boolean>()
        .doInBackground(new AsyncJob.AsyncAction<Boolean>() {
            @Override
            public Boolean doAsync() {
                // Do some background work
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                return true;
            }
        })
        .doWhenFinished(new AsyncJob.AsyncResultAction<Boolean>() {
            @Override
            public void onResult(Boolean result) {
                Toast.makeText(context, "Result was: " + result, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
}).create().start();

```

###AsyncJob static methods

Most of the time, though, I will prefer doing the following:

* Execute some code in background.
* Execute some code on the UI thread from that background thread whenever I have to, not just to return a value.

So how do yo do that?

You use the provided static methods, ``AsyncJob.doInBackground()`` and ``AsyncJob.doOnMainThread()``:

```java
AsyncJob.doInBackground(new AsyncJob.OnBackgroundJob() {
    @Override
    public void doOnBackground() {

        // Pretend it's doing some background processing
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Create a fake result (MUST be final)
        final boolean result = true;

        // Send the result to the UI thread and show it on a Toast
        AsyncJob.doOnMainThread(new AsyncJob.OnMainThreadJob() {
            @Override
            public void doInUIThread() {
                Toast.makeText(context, "Result was: "+ result, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        });
    }
});

```

Which also have some interfaces made specially for them.

##That's good, but I'd like to have a better control of my background threads!

Well, you can. You can provide an ```ExecutorService``` to an **AsyncJob** and the tasks that you want will be queued to it:

```java
// Create a job to run on background
AsyncJob.OnBackgroundJob job = new AsyncJob.OnBackgroundJob() {
    @Override
    public void doOnBackground() {
        // Pretend to do some background processing
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // This toast should show a difference of 1000ms between calls
        AsyncJob.doOnMainThread(new AsyncJob.OnMainThreadJob() {
            @Override
            public void doInUIThread() {
                Toast.makeText(context, "Finished on: "+System.currentTimeMillis(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        });
    }
};

// This ExecutorService will run only a thread at a time
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

// Send 5 jobs to queue which will be executed one at a time
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    AsyncJob.doInBackground(job, executorService);
}
```

In this example, I am supplying a SingleThreadExecutor to the AsyncJob, which will only allow **one** thread to run at a time, serializing their execution. You can provide any other ExecutorServices tof it your needs.

##How do I add it to my project?

For now, you must manually download or clone this repo and import it to your current project as a Module.

A maven repo is coming and should be enabled soon, though.

##About me:

I'm a freelance Android developer which can also code some Objective-C, Swift and little web (RoR, Django, even some NodeJS...). You can find more about me here. Bad thing is: I'm Spanish and I mostly speak Spanish on those sites. Anyway, you can contact me writing in English if you need help or want to talk.
